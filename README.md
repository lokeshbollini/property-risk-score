# property-risk-score
In this project, I developed a risk score for properties that require preservation in Buffalo city.

**Client Requirements**:
Develop a predictive model to generate risk scores for properties in Buffalo, focusing on properties over 50 years old with significant complaints.

**Final Output**: 
Began by extracting data from Buffalo City open raw data. Created a master table by joining necessary tables using SQL queries. This master table was then integrated with Tableau using GeoIDs to visualize the data on maps. Developed a Property Risk Score Prediction model using BERT and Random Forest, integrated it with Tableau, and presented the final visualization to the client. The visualization allows clients to scroll through risk scores and identify properties at high risk of damage that require immediate attention for preservation.

**Purpose and Impact:**
This data and predictive model are invaluable for government organizations, investors, and preservation communities in the Buffalo region. By identifying high-risk properties, stakeholders can prioritize development efforts and allocate resources effectively to preserve properties that are most in need of intervention, ultimately aiding in urban development and community preservation
